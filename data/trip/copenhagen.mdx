title: "Copenhagen"
summary: "I took a day trip to Copenhagen from Hamburg, traveling by ferryâ€”a great experience in itself! Once in the city, I explored the vibrant city center and its surroundings. Nyhavn stood out with its colorful buildings and lively atmosphere; it's the perfect place to relax by the water or join a canal tour for a unique view of the area. One highlight was seeing the Little Mermaid, a must-visit landmark that captures the charm of Copenhagen."
