title: "Prag"
summary: "I drove from Munich to Prague, and it was well worth the trip! Prague is a fascinating city with its medieval charm, stunning architecture, and lively energy. I started at the Old Town Square, where I admired the colorful buildings and watched the Astronomical Clock in action. Walking across the Charles Bridge gave me amazing views of the city and the towering castle above. With its rich history, art, and cozy cafes, Prague is a place Iâ€™ll never forget!"
