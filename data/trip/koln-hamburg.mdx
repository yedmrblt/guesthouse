title: "Cologne - Hamburg"
summary: "I landed in DÃ¼sseldorf and took a train to Cologne, where I spent a few hours exploring. I strolled through the streets, enjoyed a coffee and a croissant, and soaked up the atmosphere. Later, I caught a train to Hamburg, where I spent a couple of days taking in the sights and experiences of the city."
