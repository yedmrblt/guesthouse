title: "Austria"
summary: "I had a wonderful trip to Austria, visiting some amazing places! Hallstatt felt like a fairytale with its lake and pretty village. Bregenz had beautiful views of Lake Constance, and Innsbruck was surrounded by stunning mountains. In Salzburg, I enjoyed the music and history of Mozartâ€™s city. Each place was special and made the trip unforgettable!"
